Project Title - Address Book
Full Project Description  :-

Introduction :
The Address Book Management System is a modular, menu-driven C program designed to manage personal contact information.
It allows users to add, list, search, edit, and delete contacts. Each contact contains a name, phone number, and email ID. 
Data is stored persistently in a plain text file, allowing the program to retain information between sessions.
The project demonstrates strong usage of structures, string manipulation, file inpt output. 

Modules :
1. main.c
* Displays menu options
* Calls appropriate functions for each operation
* Runs the program loop until the user exits
2. contact.c
* Initializes the address book and loads data from file
* Handles creation of multiple contacts
* Lists all contacts in a formatted table
3. search.c
* Search by name 
* Search by phone number
* Search by email ID
4. edit.c
* Edit name, phone, or email of an existing contact
* Includes validation rules and duplicate checking
* Allows user to select correct contact when multiple matches exist
5. delete.c
* Delete by name, phone, or email
* Handles multiple matches by offering a selection menu
* Shifts contact records after deletion to maintain correct order
6. validation.c
  Contains strict validation rules: - 
* Name: - Must start with uppercase letter.
          No digits or special symbols allowed. 
          No leading/trailing spaces. 
          No multiple continuous spaces.

           No spaces allowed - Allowed characters before @ are letters, digits, dot, and underscore 
           Duplicate checking for phone and email
7. file.c
* Saves all contacts into a simple text file named contacts.txt
* Loads contacts from the same file when program starts


Program Flow :
1. Program starts
2. Loads existing contacts from contacts.txt
3. Displays menu to user
4. User selects an operation (create, search, edit, delete, list, save)
5. Program performs required action
6. On save, the program writes all contacts to file

How to Compile
gcc *.c 

Run the program:
./a.out

Simple Data File Format :
The program stores data in a plain text file.
Format: 1. First line contains total contact count in the form: #<number_of_contacts> 
        2. Each following line contains one contact in comma-separated format: Name,Phone,Email

Example file:
#3
John Doe,9876543210,johndoe@gmail.com
Amit Sharma,9123456789,amitsharma@gmail.com
ram Patil,9988776655,ram.patil@gmail.com
This simple format makes loading and saving operations straightforward.
